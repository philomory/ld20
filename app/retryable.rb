# Code taken from retryable gem, https://github.com/carlo/retryable/
# Too little code to justify a gem dependency, just gonna copy it here.

# Code originally by Chu Yeow, see

# Slightly rewritten to allow for passing of more than just type of exception.

    return yield
  rescue *retry_exception
    retry if (tries -= 1) > 0
